# Identifying-Ineffective-Operators
****The virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe is developing a new function that will give supervisors information on the least effective operators. An operator is considered ineffective if they have a large number of missed incoming calls (internal and external) and a long waiting time for incoming calls. Moreover, if an operator is supposed to make outgoing calls, a small number of them is also a sign of ineffectiveness.
